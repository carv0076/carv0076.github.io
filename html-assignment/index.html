  <article>About Me</article>

  <p>My name is Enzo, I was born in Belo Horizonte, Brazil on the 4. I've choosen the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program to help develop my style as a photographer, but to also give me the tools to manage a variety of media designed tasks in the real world. Some of my intrestest include: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Video Games</li>
    <li>Formula 1<sup>&trade;</sup></li>
    <li>Film</li>
    <li>Soccer</li>
    <li>History</li>
  </ul>

  <p>My <em>first</em> introduction to coding was when I took a Communication Techonology Engineering course in secondary school. I was very turned off the the idea of coding from that point on because my teacher had a lot of knowledge regarding the subject, but had absolutely no idea on how to be teacher. </p>
